## Predictive Approach (Waterfall)
![Waterfall](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/007S8ZIlgy1gf8dy0kl9ej31gs0jc45m.jpg)
- Characteristic 1: Requirements are well understood
- Characteristic 2: Requirements are stable (not changing)
- Characteristic 3: Software project has a low technical risk
- Characteristic 4: S/w project can be planned in advance
- Characteristic 5: Software system can be developed, according to intended plan

## Adaptive Approach (Agile)
- Characteristic 1: Iterative development • Characteristic 2: The number of iterations cannot be anticipated in advance
- Characteristic 3: The time requirements ofeach iteration could vary
- Characteristic 4: Requirements change(Unstable) during the project
- Characteristic 5: Requirements are uncertain (ill-structured)
- Characteristic 6: Software project has a high technical risk
- Characteristic 7: Software project must be flexible (in terms of requirements variation, time, iterations)

### FOUR Agile Values
#### Value 1: Responding to change
1. Quick changes are to be expected
2. flexibility than rigidity in ideas, requirements over following a plan
#### Value 2: Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
1. Frequent communications among stakeholders are important
2. Do not over emphasis on the use of tools like Lucid Charts, Visio etc
#### Value 3: Value working software over comprehensive documentation
1. Less emphasis on proper documentation using models
2. Emphasises on right amount of details
#### Value 4: Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
1. More and frequent inputs from users (rather than on fixed requirements)

### 12 Principles
#### Principle 1: Develop software as the primary goal
1. Don’t get distracted by documentation or models
#### Principle 2: Enable the next effort as your secondary goal
1. Some models may be necessary to support maintenance and upgrade rather than initial coding
#### Principle 3: Minimise your modeling activity
1. Only create those models that are necessary
#### Principle 4: Embrace change and change incrementally
1. Take small steps that keep you on-track and that can be
reversed ,if necessary
#### Principle 5: Model with a purpose
1. Model to understand
2. Model to communicate
3. Model for maintenance (future work)
#### Principle 6: Build multiple models
1. Look at problems from different perspectives (e.g. process,
data)
#### Principle 7: Build high
1. quality models and get feedback – Seek quick feedback from end-users and other developers
#### Principle 8: Focus on content rather than representation 
1. Informal hand-drawn models are sometimes okay
2. Always focus on stakeholder needs
#### Principle 9: Learn from each other with open communication
1. Do not be DEFENSIVE of models
2. Open communication and debate
#### Principle 10: Know your models and how to
use them
1. Know the strengths and weaknesses of
models
#### Principle 11: Adapt to specific project needs
1. Each project is unique
2. Stakeholders differ
3. Development platform differ
#### Principle 12: Maximise stakeholder ROI
1. Stakeholders include: sponsor, end-users, managers who have an interest, developers
2. Without stakeholders, no software projects exist
3. Emphasise on benefits
